# My first consulting job interview sample code

I wrote this on February 14, 2009 for a consulting client that I was
trying to work for. I had never written any Django code before nor ever
worked with Google App Engine. This was a small challenge he gave me to
see if I could learn it quickly and if he could understand the work I
was doing well enough.

Turned out he did hire me, even though looking back this code was
horrendously simple and misunderstood. I barely knew what any of it did
and you can tell that by there being no `head` tags or anything like
that. No templates either. ðŸ¤“
